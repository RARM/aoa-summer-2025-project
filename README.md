## Brute Force Approach

The brute force approach to the closest pair problem involves checking the distance between every pair of points in the given set. This method is straightforward but inefficient, with a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of points.

### Steps:
1. Initialize a variable to store the minimum distance found.
2. Iterate through each point and calculate the distance to every other point.
3. Update the minimum distance if a smaller distance is found.
4. Return the minimum distance.

## Divide and Conquer Approach

The divide and conquer approach is more efficient, with a time complexity of O(n log n). This method involves recursively dividing the set of points into smaller subsets, finding the closest pair in each subset, and then merging the results.

### Steps:
1. Sort the points by their x-coordinates.
2. Recursively divide the set into two halves.
3. Find the closest pair in each half.
4. Check for possible closer pairs across the dividing line.
5. Return the overall closest pair.
